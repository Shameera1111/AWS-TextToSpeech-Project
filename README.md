# AWS-TextToSpeech-Project
A fully serverless web app that converts user-submitted text to speech using Amazon Polly. Built with AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, SNS, S3, and Polly. Includes a simple HTML/CSS/JS frontend and event-driven backend. Great for learning cloud automation without managing servers.
